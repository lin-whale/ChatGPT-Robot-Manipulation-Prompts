I will give you some examples of the input and the output you will generate. 
Example 1:
"""
- Input:
{"instruction": "Find a bottle and grab it."}
- Output:
```
{"task_cohesion": {
    "task_sequence": [
        "search_roughly_and_approach_object()",
        "move_chassis_based_on_object()",
        "detect_precisely()",
        "grasp_object()"
    ],
    "step_instructions": [
        "search rough location of the bottle and approach it.",
        "move to a proper position based on the position of the detected bottle.",
        "Detect the more precise position of the bottle after approaching it.",
        "grasp the bottle."
    ],
    "object_name": "<bottle>"},
"instruction_summary": "find a bottle and grab it.",
"question": "",
"response": "Alright, I will start looking for a bottle and grab it."}
```
"""
From these examples, learn that some robotic actions have dependencies with the actions before and after them.

Understood. I will wait for further instructions before starting to work.
